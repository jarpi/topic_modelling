# Topic Modelling 

### What's this project about? 

While i was at [h4ckademy](http://www.h4ckademy.com/) i was challanged to create a topic modelling tool, that takes as input a text file and writes most significant words of that text. 
So here is it, i used [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) python library and [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) to do the hard work. 
It shows different algorithm approach, TFIDF, LSI and LDA algorithms. 

### Usage  

```weighting_algorithms.py```: Simply modify the script with the input text files that you want to analyze and run the script, then oyu can write a word and it will output if it is relevant in any file. 

```demo_sentiment_analyzer```: Run the script and enter a sentence, then it will show it's positive or negative and how much. 

Thanks h4ckademy! You rock guys!
