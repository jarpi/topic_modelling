SENTENCE: this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood ' s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . this is the best we ' ve seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) . this film begins an unspecified time following the happily - ever - after conclusion to toy story . in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " . one day , andy broke woody ' s arm off , while playing with him . woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . later andy ' s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son ' s room . since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody ' s roundup . " if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . so , after andy ' s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it ' s up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . the problem is , if woody escapes from al ' s clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . a real effort is made in the technical department . the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close - ups that really make an impression . lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie ' s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in - side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " . the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . unexpected because the first film wasn ' t much more than a demonstration of special effects . but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn ' t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . this is a big step - away from the ancient laws of disney - animation . off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you ' ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year . i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn ' t lost their ability to entertain .

SENTENCE: i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown - ups . it certainly didn ' t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom - to - be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his " last night of freedom . " ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom - and - gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this ' till death do you part business . then , on an ill - fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free - spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three - day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he ' s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she ' s never had . forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . ben is an ideal role for affleck ' s easy - going charm , and he plays the straight - laced straight man without forced exasperation . sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half - dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . the two performances -- part of a great top - to - bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script ' s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self - justification . the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . forces of nature isn ' t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it ' s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it ' s not what he thought it was . lawrence ' s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you ' ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . that is , provided you ' re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over - directed scenes of the year : teetering hand - held shots , why - not low or high angles , sweeping pans . occasionally the hyper - real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can ' t find what ' s underneath . a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes ' excesses can ' t spoil this unique concoction . forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .

SENTENCE: is evil dead ii a bad movie ? it ' s full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . ` well what ' s it about ? ' ` five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . ' ` come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . why should i see it again ? ' ` no evil dead ii is different , it ' s funny . ' ` it ' s funny to see people die ? are you sick or something ? ' maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . an example of raimi ' s odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash ' s girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . sure it ' s over - the - top , but it is so over - the - top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell ' s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . but it doesn ' t end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster - like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers ' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn ' t wait to make it ' s sequel .

SENTENCE: [ note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh ' s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . as it happens , it didn ' t take long . ] is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968 ' s romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . it is zeffirelli ' s genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . in this italian master ' s hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son ' s worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then - reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a " lethal weapon " ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? franco zeffirelli , that ' s who . and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film ' s end . glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet ' s mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i ' m still trying to understand the character as written . ( zeffirelli ' s incestuous interpretation of hamlet ' s relationship with his mother doesn ' t help . ) alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare " this is important ; this is shakespeare ! " i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare " definitive . " and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . but if you ' ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start .

SENTENCE: georges polti once wrote a paper called " the thirty - six dramatic situations , " in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty - six different situations . this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , " there ' s nothing new under the sun . " the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . there ' s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day - style but rather " through the back door . " parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run - down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . the lack of gusto is the movie ' s major stumbling block . even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they ' ve been saved by an energetic approach . this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson ' s ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven - directed scream but couldn ' t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . although he designs the faculty with more of a sci - fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up - and - comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they ' d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson ' s creek . " needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci - fi direction to make any use of it . in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .
